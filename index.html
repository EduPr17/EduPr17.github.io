<p>My name is Edu Pena, I am from Lima, Peru; I lived 13 years in that beautiful and amazing city, but in 2016 my family decided to travel to the U.S.A, actually to North Bergen, New Jersey. It is a beautiful city, where I have met amazing people such as Marco, Brian, Marlon, Paulina, etc. In this city I have learned the reality of life, I have seen that life is not all about money; it is also about the familial love,friendship, etc. I also appreciated that this is the land of oportunities. In my case, an opportunity appeared in the best moment possible, my family wasnÂ´t in a good condition in reference to money and love. Everyone was all about fights, etc; but STEM appeared. This was a hard opportunity, I did not know if I should stay or leave it.... My mom got so mad at me; she started saying: "How are you going to leave that opportunity!" I was decided, I did not want to be here. This was not what I wanted. At this point, I feel the same... I am not comfortable here. I do not have friends here... just classmates, and more classmates. I do not like to be like "shy" or "angry" every single time, but that is the only thing I can do. My grades are not a problem, but my feeling are. It feels really really bad. English is also a problem,  my first language is Spanish... although I really want to learn, I see that probability farther each day. I want to retrun to Peru because of my family, and my life. Life there was amazing... Well, this is my life, I really hope it changes... </p>
